# After completing this section, you will be able to:
#
# Use multivariate regression to adjust for confounders. Write linear models to
# describe the relationship between two or more variables. Calculate the least
# squares estimates for a regression model using the lm function. Understand the
# differences between tibbles and data frames. Use the do function to bridge R
# functions and the tidyverse. Use the tidy, glance, and augment functions from
# the broom package. Apply linear regression to measurement error models. This
# section has four parts: Introduction to Linear Models, Least Squares
# Estimates, Tibbles, do, and broom, and Regression and Baseball. There are
# comprehension checks that follow most videos.
