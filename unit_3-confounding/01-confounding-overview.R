#
# Identify examples of spurious correlation and explain how data dredging can
# lead to spurious correlation. Explain how outliers can drive correlation and
# learn to adjust for outliers using Spearman correlation. Explain how reversing
# cause and effect can lead to associations being confused with causation.
# Understand how confounders can lead to the misinterpretation of associations.
# Explain and give examples of Simpson's Paradox. This section has one part:
# Correlation is Not Causation. There are comprehension checks that follow most
